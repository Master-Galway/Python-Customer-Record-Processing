# Python-Customer-Record-Processing
The implementation uses Python 3. The main concept is to use nested dictionary to store and access data.

Users can continue importing customer records, and can terminate the program anytime by typing "STOP"/"stop". A result will be generated on the console.

For every line of input, the program will generate one cooresponding evaluation.

Users can choose to either type in each customer record on the console, or import a CSV file.

Users can choose to export a csv file without terminating the program.

One month is always counted as 30 days.
